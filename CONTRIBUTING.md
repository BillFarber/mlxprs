# Contributing to mlxprs

mlxprs is still pretty new, so bugs are likely and features might be thin for your taste.
You can help by identifying bugs, requesting features you'd like to see, or even submitting code.
 
## Got a Question or Problem?

For now, just email me at dpquinlan@gmail.com or on twitter @blockedport. I'll do my best to respond quickly.

## Found a bug or issue?

If you find a problem, or want to request something that's lacking, feel free to use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mikrovvelle/mlxprs/issues).
Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix for the issue you filed.

If you would like to implement a new feature, it's probably wise to first create a new issue and then discuss implementation details with me.

### Submitting an Issue

Please check the issue tracker before you submit an issue search, to help avoid duplicates. If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. 

The following information is most helpful:

* **Overview of the Issue** — Be clear. What should happen? What does happen?
* **Steps to reproduce** — What exactly do I need to do to experience the issue?
* **Use Case** — If it's not obvious, explain why this is a bug for you
* **Environment** — Mac, windows, MarkLogic version, VS Code version?
* **Pointers** — If you have a hunch or just don't want to bother with a pull request,
please point me in the right direction (e.g. line numbers) to fix it.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Please refer to [Github's documentation on the matter](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

#### Formatting code

I use [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org) for consistent code formatting.
If you're developing this extension, you're probably using VS Code, so you should probably
install the [editorconfig VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig).
